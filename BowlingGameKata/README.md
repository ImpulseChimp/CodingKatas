# BowlingGameKata
This kata is a simple teaching point for Red/Green/Refactor design. It is taken from the infamous UncleBobs website and
is focused on solving a problem by refactoring vs jumping to a solution right away. My solution started with no code and
took shape with each commit to this repo representing a small milestone in the process.
