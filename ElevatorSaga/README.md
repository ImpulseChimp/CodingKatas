# ElevatorSaga
This holds all of my solutions to the ElevatorSaga Javascript puzzle level 1-18. For each solution, you can copy and past
the code into the online interpreter on the website liked below. Most solutions build off of eachother by starting with
the previous levels code and adding or removing functionality to fit the problem.

***Note:*** Most solutions above do not have 100% success rate due to the random nature of the puzzles in the ElevatorSaga.
Instead, a success rate of at least 60% was my criteria for moving to the next level.
