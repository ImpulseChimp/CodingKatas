# GildedRoseKata
A coding kata exercise on extreme code refactoring using the popular GildedRose problem. You are given an inventory of items
that degrade over time in different ways and have different rules built into them. All of the original code is designed in one file
with no attempt at a clean OO design. The kata is to turn the mess of a design into as clean of a solution as possible that takes
advantage of design patterns, class relationships and readable code formatting.

My first commit to this repo is stage one of the unrefactored code while the last is my final solution that I came to after
many iterations. Everything was wrapped around with tests to guarantee functionality was preserved.
