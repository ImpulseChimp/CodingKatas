# MarsRoverKata
This is a coding kata that is focused on Red/Green/Refactor design. Starting with an empty project, you design a Mars Rover that
satisfies the requirements posted on the link below. At each step, you wrap the intended functionality with tests, write the code
to make the tests pass, then refactor your design. This is intened as an excercise in refactoring and turning initial solutions
into powerful OO and pattern based designs.
