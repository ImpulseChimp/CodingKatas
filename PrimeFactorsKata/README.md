# PrimeFactorsKata
This is a coding kata that focuses on learning Red/Green/Refactor as a design process. The goal is to find all of the prime
factors for any number entered in and retun it as a list of values. This starts out with no code and quickly shapes the
solution during each iteration of the process. The steps were taken from the infamous Uncle Bobs website.
