# StringCalculatorKata
This coding kata is focused on Test Drived Design (TDD). The ultimate goal is to create a small program that can calculate
values from strings in several formats of inputs. Each problem is introduced one step at a time and should be solved by 
testing first and writing code second. The instructions were taken from Roy Osheroves website linked below.
