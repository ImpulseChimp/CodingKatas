# VideoStoreKata

This is a coding kata based on refactoring a set program into a more OO design. This excercise of design started
with the initial commit in this repo of unfactored C# code.
- [Original Unrefactored Code](https://github.com/ImpulseChimp/VideoStoreKata/tree/8f4d48c021834665cddf1782652b2ae041066690)

The most recent commit to this repo represents the final solution and contains 100% test coverage.
